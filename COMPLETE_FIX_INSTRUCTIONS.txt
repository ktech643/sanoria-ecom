```

Check network status:
```
adb shell dumpsys telephony.registry | grep -E "mServiceState|mDataNetworkType|mDataConnectionState"
```

TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. IF SHOWING "E" OR "H" INSTEAD OF 4G:
   - Your area might not have LTE coverage
   - In *#*#4636#*#*, try different network modes:
     * LTE only (mode 11)
     * LTE/WCDMA (mode 12)
     * GSM/WCDMA/LTE (mode 10)

2. IF NO MOBILE DATA:
   ```
   adb shell
   su
   # Reset everything
   settings delete global mobile_data
   settings delete global preferred_network_mode
   rm -rf /data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/*
   reboot
   ```
   
3. VERIFY SIM CARD:
   - Test SIM in another phone
   - Make sure data plan is active
   - Contact carrier to verify:
     * LTE is enabled on your account
     * APN settings are correct
     * No data blocks on account

4. NUCLEAR OPTION:
   If nothing works:
   - Backup your data
   - Settings → General management → Reset
   - Reset network settings
   - Reinstall the module

5. ALTERNATIVE FIX:
   Try forcing different radio modes:
   ```
   adb shell
   su
   # Try mode 9 (LTE/GSM)
   settings put global preferred_network_mode 9
   setprop ctl.restart rild
   ```

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Network shows 4G/LTE (not E or IWLAN)
2. Mobile data toggle works
3. Can browse internet
4. Can use apps requiring data

The module will continuously monitor and prevent IWLAN from taking over.
