IWLAN to GSM/LTE Converter - Samsung S21 FE
===========================================

FILE: iwlan_to_gsm.zip

This module completely disables IWLAN and forces GSM/LTE only mode.

WHAT IT DOES:
1. Disables all IWLAN packages (com.sec.epdg, com.samsung.android.iwlan, etc.)
2. Blocks IMS/VoLTE/VoWiFi services
3. Forces network mode to LTE/GSM (mode 9)
4. Continuously monitors and kills IWLAN if it tries to restart
5. Adds system permissions to disable IWLAN features

INSTALLATION:
1. Uninstall any previous network fix modules
2. Reboot
3. Install iwlan_to_gsm.zip via Magisk
4. Reboot
5. Wait 3-5 minutes for full effect

IMPORTANT MANUAL STEPS AFTER INSTALLATION:

1. DIAL *#*#4636#*#*:
   - Tap "Phone Information"
   - Set "Preferred Network Type" to:
     * Try "LTE/GSM auto (PRL)" first
     * If that doesn't work, try "GSM only"
     * Then try "LTE only"
   - Turn OFF all IMS registration options
   - Turn OFF "VoLTE provisioned"

2. DEVELOPER OPTIONS:
   - Enable Developer Options
   - Go to Developer Options
   - Find "Mobile data always active" - Turn it ON

3. APN SETTINGS:
   - Settings → Connections → Mobile networks → Access Point Names
   - Check that your carrier's APN is properly configured
   - If not, add a new APN with your carrier's settings

4. SIM CARD CHECK:
   - Try your SIM in another phone to verify 4G works
   - Try another 4G SIM in your S21 FE
   - This will confirm if it's a device or SIM issue

NETWORK MODES REFERENCE:
Mode 0 = GSM only
Mode 1 = GSM/WCDMA (WCDMA preferred)
Mode 2 = WCDMA only  
Mode 9 = LTE/GSM auto (PRL)
Mode 10 = LTE only
Mode 11 = LTE/WCDMA

VERIFICATION:
Check if IWLAN is disabled:
```
adb shell dumpsys telephony.registry | grep mDataNetworkType
```
Should show: GSM, EDGE, UMTS, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA, LTE (NOT IWLAN)

Check disabled packages:
```
adb shell pm list packages -d | grep -E "iwlan|epdg|imsservice"
```

TROUBLESHOOTING:
If still showing E instead of 4G/LTE:

1. Your area might only have 2G/EDGE coverage
2. Your SIM might not be provisioned for 4G
3. Try manual network selection:
   - Settings → Connections → Mobile networks → Network operators
   - Turn off automatic and manually select your carrier

4. Last resort - Reset network completely:
   ```
   adb shell
   su
   rm -rf /data/misc/radio/*
   rm -rf /data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/*
   reboot
   ```

The module will prevent IWLAN from taking over your connection.
